# GP_Milk_Content_Prediction


TODO:


- Collect all the exercises to be done from different classes and write the code
- Data exploration of the dataset
- Data preprocessing (Scaling, train/val/test split, missing values/outliers)
- Different models with different parameters training, tuning and evaluation (GP, GSGP, Efficient GSGP, NN in Pytorch, NEAT)
- Using statistical tests co compare performance of different models on test data
- Write the report
